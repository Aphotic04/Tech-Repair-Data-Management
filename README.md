# Tech-Repair-Date-Management
A JavaFX program (JDK 13.0.2) meant to be of practical use to a tech repair business for editing, creating, deleting, storing, and loading data on customers, their transactions, and the items within the transactions.

This project is my pride and joy; I am absolutely so proud with how it turned out and how many different little functions there are.

How to Operate:
Enter "\populateDirectory" into the Customer ID Search to instantly populate with customers, else you can add your own
Highlight (single click) a customer then press the "New" button under transactions to create a transaction within that customer; same process with a transaction and adding items
Highlighting any cell will instantly populate the following ListView with the objects within it
The "Delete" button deletes highlighted cells
Double click a cell (table or list) to edit the specifics and press the "Update" button to save the details
When prompted with a window to choose a customer type or item type, press the X to exit the window to save the option
