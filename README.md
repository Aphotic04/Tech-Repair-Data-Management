# Tech-Repair-Date-Management
A JavaFX program (JDK 13.0.2) meant to be of practical use to a tech repair business for editing, creating, deleting, storing, and loading data on customers, their transactions, and the items within the transactions.

This project is my pride and joy; I am absolutely so proud with how it turned out and how many different little functions there are.
